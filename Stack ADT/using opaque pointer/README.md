# Implementation of stack using opaque pointer in C

This showcases an implementation of a stack using the `opaque pointer` concept in the `C` programming language. It consists of three files:

- `stack.h`: This is the header file that contains the declarations of the functions and data structures used in the stack implementation.
- `stack.c`: This file contains the actual implementation of the stack functions defined in the header file.
- `main.c`: This is the driver code that demonstrates how to use the stack functions.

### > How to compile & run

- Compile with `gcc stack.c main.c`.
- Run with `./a.out` (Linux environment) or `.\a.exe` (Windows environment).
